in the asynchronous.py file include some practical with asynchoroonus programming in python

I have made 3 part with how to make 5 request as a example and how much time taken to finish 5 request

first part include just using requests library in python to make 5 request and take long time to finish 5 request due to blocking/ syncronous

Second part include asyncio library to perform asynchonous way , it reduce the time taken to rather than first part but it use two thread to 
handle the process

In third part use aiohttp library instead of using request library , it make sure modern asynchronous programming without using threded environment.
